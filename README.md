## Background
The goals of this project were to:
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

This app was created by two developers who are 4 months into a Front End coding program. We spent approximately 30 hours creating this project and was our first introduction to using React. 

## Future Directions and Additions
- Add search feature for movie title or genres
- Improve app responsiveness to varying screen sizes
- Write more robust Cypress tests
